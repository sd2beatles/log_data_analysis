1) Introduction

Online business is now enjoying an unprecedented level of popularity compared to the last decade. However, every online business has steps that people must take to become a customer.  The people who simply visit the sites are not customers, but sign up for your online service or purchase a product from your website. Therefore, to take a very in-depth look into how consumers behave is an essential task every analyst should take.  

2) Goal and Project

It is my first time to manage the pretty a large size of data with excessive use of SQL queries for data analysis. Although Pandas, one of the Data Frame libraries provided by Python, might have been deployed to analyze the data-set, it takes much longer to process the queries for ceratin tasks than under SQL. I decide to take a combination of both programs for the convenience. ( Almost 80 % of data has been performed using SQL queries)

3) Data
